"""
Cell watcher for detecting queued cell executions in Jupyter notebooks.

If someone does "Run All" on a notebook with %%cc blocks,
we don't want Claude to run again. Unfortunately, queued
cells are a client-side construct (they aren't preemptively
sent to the kernel), so we use hooks to watch for the execution
time in between cells.
